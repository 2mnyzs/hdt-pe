# Setup: Step by Step setup basics for HDT Physics Extension #

This guide will get it working first. You can THEN install add-ons afterwards.


---

### Install SKSE. ###
Required: [Minimum v1.6.16](http://skse.silverlock.org/).

---

### Install a body with T/BBP compatibility. ###
T/BBP is _**REQUIRED.**_ Well known bodies and their derivatives will clearly say in their title, features, or related documentation. If it doesn't say, _assume that it isn't compatible_ and look for an alternative.

---

### Install skeleton with BBP or TBBP compatibility. ###
Required. Start [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?) if you need one. Most often, this will be an xp32 created skeleton. Others will say in their documentation.

---

### Download the HDT plugin for SKSE. ###
Required: Go [Home > Download](https://code.google.com/p/hdt-pe/) section if you need it.

---

### Install with a mod manager or open the zip into the Skyrim game directory. ###
If you're using a version older than v12-29:
  1. Open the directory: Skyrim/data/SKSE/plugins/   (If this dir doesn't exist, create it. Go ahead, it's ok.)
  1. Copy in the files hdtPhysicsExtensions.dll and hdtPhysicsExtensionsDefaultBBP.xml
  1. v9-23 or earlier: Remove the date from the plugin dll filename so that it is now hdtPhysicsExtensions.dll.

---

## Done. ##
Enjoy the show!
